# SAC-Portal-V2
Currently there are different Whatsapp/Facebook groups of different clubs and they inform about their events and sessions over there or over the mail. So there are chances that someone who is really interested in that club can miss a particular event. This app will help in managing all the events and also help in resolving conflicts.
Students could subscribe to events and clubs and will be notified accordingly.
Also, club coordinators can plan their events so that there ainâ€™t any conflict with an existing event.
More features could be added over time.
